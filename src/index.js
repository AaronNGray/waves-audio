/**
 * @class TimeEngine
 * @classdesc Base class for time engines
 *
 * Time engines are components that generate more or less regular audio events and/or playback a media stream.
 * They implement one or multiple imterfaces to be synchronized by a master such as a scheduler, a transport or a play-control.
 * The provided interfaces are "scheduled", "transported", and "play-controlled".
 * 
 * In the "scheduled" interface the engine implements a method "advanceTime" that is called by the master (usually teh scheduler) 
 * and returns the delay until the next call of "advanceTime". The master provides the engien with a function "resetNextTime" 
 * to reschedule the next call to another time.
 *
 * In the "transported" interface the master (usually a transport) first calls the method "syncPosition" that returns the position
 * of the first event generated by the engine regarding the playing direction (sign of the speed argument). Events are generated 
 * through the method "advancePosition" that returns the position of the next event generated through "advancePosition".
 *
 * In the "speed-controlled" interface the engine is controlled by the method "syncSpeed".
 *
 * For all interfaces the engine is provided with the attribute getters "currentTime" and "currentPosition" (for the case that the master 
 * does not implement these attributte getters, the base class provides default implementations).
