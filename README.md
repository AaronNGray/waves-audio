## scheduler

> WAVE audio event scheduler singleton

The simple scheduler is a simplified version of the [scheduler]https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/scheduler).
Other than the scheduler, the simple scheduler does not respect the order of the scheduled events below the scheduler period.

## API

The simple scheduler has the same methods and attributes as the [scheduler]https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/scheduler).

### Status

This library is under heavy development and subject to change.  
Every new API breaking change we will be adding snapshots to the repository so you can always fetch a working copy.
